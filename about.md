Co:Read

I needed an app that helped me get the most out of the books I read.  The app generates a quiz based on the notes you take.  In order to continue taking notes you must successfully complete the quiz.  I built it using Angular, Bootstrap and Firebase.

Check it out for yourself [here](https://co-read-quiz.firebaseapp.com/?#/QuizApp/login).
Checkout the code on [github](https://github.com/rsheldon3ayers/capstone).

Lives of The Poets

This is a digitized abridgment of Dr. Johnson's seminal work on the most significant poets of the eighteenth century. I used Node, Express and MongoDB on the back-end and Foundation for styling purposes.

It's a work in progress.  Check it out on [github](https://github.com/rsheldon3ayers/lives-of-the-poets).
