Doctor Johnson stands in my estimation at the pinnacle of moral thought.  The world remembers him as a writer of dictionaries, poet and wit.  When he is quoted it is usually in a context far removed from his own.  Many on the Internet copy and paste quotes in a hurried pace, without noticing the source.  My favorite instance is when I noticed Henry Adams quote in praise of teachers pasted over a pretty picture.  Adams's seldom intended to inspire with his writing.  I stand guilty guilty of this as much as anyone else.  A quick Google search leads to me quotes learned and wise and I pilfer them without much regard their author's original intent.

Samuel Johnson is best taken at his word.  The reason I decided to read all of The Rambler on the corresponding dates of publication, is to surrender myself to  Johnson's context and perhaps attain his true intention.  I want him to mold my point of view.

The essays of the Rambler were written two week and appeared on Tuesday and Saturday.  Even if you can't resist the comparison of a blog the depth of content will soon convince you otherwise. Perhaps the eighteenth century mind could consume depth better than the twenty-first or, more likely, Doctor Johnson never had a little thought in is life.  You could consume these essays the way we do blog posts but then you would probably miss the point.  The reason we can still walk into a library or bookstore and see these essays on the shelf is because they defy consumption.

Let me give an example:  The first entry is about beginnings.  He considers the ways in which society inaugurates undertaking of different sorts other than writing.  There is no accepted ceremony
