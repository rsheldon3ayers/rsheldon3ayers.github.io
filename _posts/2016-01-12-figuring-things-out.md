I have started to build this site with Jekyll and there is a bit of a learning curve.  First, I want to push myself to learn Markdown, which doesn't seem to be too lofty a goal.  Markdown is intended to save time.  So, I consider it worth the effort to learn it.  Second, jekyll has a lot of cool tools that I need to wrap my head around.

As an apprentice developer at Nashville Software School I've learned a lot in 4 months and I am eager to stretch my mind and expand my skill set.
