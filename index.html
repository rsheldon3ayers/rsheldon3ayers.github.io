        <p>Since I was 15 years old I’ve had a curiosity for things I can’t understand. Anything from philosophy to literature to history or science, I followed my curiosity no matter how lost I became and read my way out of ignorance. I’ll make no attempt to say I was able to grasp everything on my own but that never stopped me from trying. Anything that claimed to be “above my head” was an invitation to explore. When I came across coding languages for the first time I was instantly hooked. The weird syntax and reappropriated vocabulary challenged me like nothing before.  After a year of trying on my own I finally admitted defeat and applied to Nashville Software School. After 6 months of intensive training I was able to grasp the fundamentals and launch out on my own, once again following my curiosity. I’m hungry to learn more everyday.

        <p>I’m currently looking for a junior developer role that will strengthen my knowledge in a real world setting and push me out of my intellectual comfort zone. My past experiences in customer service and the restaurant industry have taught me the art of collaboration and genuine hospitality. I welcome interactions with different personalities and views. The fast pace of a busy dinner shift has taught me to think quite literally on my feet and has made me comfortable being uncomfortable. I’m confident that the years of reading in my room coupled with the lessons of customer service have made me perfect for my future career as a software developer.
