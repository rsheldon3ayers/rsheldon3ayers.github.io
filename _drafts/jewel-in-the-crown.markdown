#Jewel In The Crown

This first volume of Paul Scott's _Raj Quartet_ sets out to tell  of the last days of British rule in India.  The simple plot is peopled with characters that , on a whole, are representative not only of their time and place in the novel of the universal human experience.  I'm sure Scott's intentions included this but his technique seems to  be unaware.  The story, as he states in the first page, is of a rape.  The reader instantly takes this to be the actual rape of a woman but the language indicates a metaphorical rape of India.  But not _just_ India, in my view.  The metaphor can extend to the lives of even the soldiers and civil servants that serve in the region.  The stoic brigadier, the dutiful, sinister Ronald Merrick, and the cynical vice consul White.  And Hari Kumar.
