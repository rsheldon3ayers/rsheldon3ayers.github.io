#V. S. Naipaul

The writer V.S. Naipaul projects himself in a series of contradictory personalities.  His writing maintains an unsentimental  sympathy for the weak and marginalized of the world.  The power of his observation - his ability to select the perfect image, event or personality - directs the reader's gaze to what can only be called the truth.  Naipaul sees everything.  There is no obvious attempt at 'relevance'.  His politics are often called conservative, but his works are never driven by politics.  Which accounts for their timeless qualities.  The fact of politics is universal but the writer's political concerns more often obscures the work's central message.  And a work whose central message or arguments insists on being political is not worth keeping around.

The public persona however, provokes controversy.  He is no liberal.
